# Raise_Flutter

Clone the current Raise project with Flutter.


## Run this project.
Because current flutter version not support web, we need to change to Flutter beta version.

Your flutter version should be:
```
flutter channel beta
   flutter config --enable-web
   flutter run -d chrome
```


Run with:
`flutter run --web-renderer html`
